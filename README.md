# CRUD Operations with jQuery Ajax & Bootstrap Modal
Basic CRUD Application projects that perform CRUD operations to use jQuery Ajax for ASP.NET Core Web API, using Bootstrap Modal.

In the project I used Visual Studio and .NET to build the Web API service.
I showed to add, edit, and delete data in an HTML table using JavaScript and jQuery methods. (using data retrieved from your Web API)

I focused on the four standard HTTP verbs that use to work with the Web API controller class: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 
1) The GET verb retrieves a list of data, or a single item of data. 
2) POST sends new data to the server. 
3) The PUT verb updates an existing row of data. 
4) DELETE sends a request to remove a row of data.
